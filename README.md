# The Orbital Object Ontology (OOO)
OOO is an ontology representing objects in orbit about Earth. It represents obital objects and their interactions in the orbital environment.

## Status
* Seeking opportunity to sustainably develop this project. 
* Seeking funding, partners, PhD position or a job to realize the concept.
CONTEXT: This has been a pursuit since 2011, when I conceived the concept (documentation/references verifying this available upon request). Since then I've been seeking a sustainable opportunity (employment, PhD fellowship, research position, etc.) to work on, develop, and implement this. I have conceptualized and developed enough paper ideas on this to make it a Phd project. 

### NOTE
* OOO classes may be part of a broader Space Domain Ontology (SDO), Space Situational Awareness Ontology (SSAO), or Space Object Ontology (SOO)--see my other repositories. Further development is in order.
* Classes from my Orbital Debris Ontology (ODO) would be a part of this broader ontology.

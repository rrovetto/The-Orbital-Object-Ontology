#The Orbital Object Ontology (OOO)
OOO is an ontology representing objects in orbit about Earth.

###NOTE###
* OOO classes may be part of a broader Space Situational Awareness Ontology (SSAO), Space Object Ontology (SOO), or Space Domain Ontology (SDO)--see other repositories by Rovetto.
* Classes from the Orbital Debris Ontology may be a part of this broader ontology.

##Status##
* Seeking opportunity to develop this project. 
* Seeking funding, partners, PhD position or a job to realize the concept.
CONTEXT: This has been a pursuit since 2011, when I conceived the concept (documentation/references verifying this available upon request). Since then I've been seeking a sustainable opportunity (employment, PhD fellowship, research position, etc.) to work on, develop, and implement this. I have conceptualized and developed enough paper ideas on this to make it a Phd project.
